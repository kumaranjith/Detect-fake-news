# Detect-fake-news
      This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. 
      Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. 
      Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model.
      In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
